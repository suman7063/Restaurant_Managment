Restaurant Management System - Complete Product Requirements Document
Executive Summary
The Restaurant Management System is a comprehensive B2B SaaS solution designed for fine dining and casual dining restaurants. The core innovation is QR code-based table ordering with real-time multi-kitchen workflow management, individual item-level status tracking and delivery, and flexible multi-language support. The system enables independent item delivery (waiters can deliver items as soon as they're ready without waiting for the entire order) and supports per-item special requests visible to chefs. The system streamlines operations from customer ordering through kitchen preparation to individual item delivery, with English as the mandatory base language and optional local language support.
