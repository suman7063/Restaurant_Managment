## Implementation Notes

### Database Migration Strategy:
1. Create migration scripts for each schema update
2. Test migrations on development database
3. Backup production data before applying changes
4. Apply migrations in order of priority

### Development Approach:
1. Start with Priority 1 tasks (database schema)
2. Implement core features (Priority 2) incrementally
3. Test each feature thoroughly before moving to next
4. Maintain backward compatibility during transitions

### Testing Strategy:
1. Test database schema changes first
2. Verify data integrity after migrations
3. Test user flows end-to-end
4. Performance testing for real-time features

### Deployment Considerations:
1. Database migrations must be applied before code deployment
2. Real-time features require WebSocket server setup
3. Multi-language content needs proper encoding
4. Monitor performance impact of new features
