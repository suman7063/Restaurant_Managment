-- Fix Row Level Security (RLS) Policies for restaurant_tables
-- This fixes the "new row violates row-level security policy" error

-- Step 1: Drop existing policies (if they exist)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can insert tables within restaurant" ON restaurant_tables;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow table creation during development" ON restaurant_tables;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Staff can delete tables within restaurant" ON restaurant_tables;

-- Step 2: Create INSERT policy for admin/owner users
CREATE POLICY "Staff can insert tables within restaurant" ON restaurant_tables
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    restaurant_id IS NOT NULL AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users 
      WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
      AND users.restaurant_id = restaurant_tables.restaurant_id
      AND users.role IN ('admin', 'owner')
    )
  );

-- Step 3: Create development-friendly INSERT policy (for testing without auth)
CREATE POLICY "Allow table creation during development" ON restaurant_tables
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (restaurant_id IS NOT NULL);

-- Step 4: Create DELETE policy for admin/owner users
CREATE POLICY "Staff can delete tables within restaurant" ON restaurant_tables
  FOR DELETE USING (
    restaurant_id IS NOT NULL AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM users 
      WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
      AND users.restaurant_id = restaurant_tables.restaurant_id
      AND users.role IN ('admin', 'owner')
    )
  );

-- Step 5: Verify policies are created
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'restaurant_tables'
ORDER BY policyname;
